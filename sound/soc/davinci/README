There are two ways to do this -

One is to use a modifed copy of bfin-eval-adau1x61.c as microburst.c
This is saved as microburst-from-bfin.c

The other is to use a modified copy of davinci-evm.c
this is saved as microburst-from-davinci.c

TODO edit microburst.c, copy to microburst-from-davinci and build it
